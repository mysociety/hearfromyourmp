Subject: HearFromYourCouncillor update - you've now got <?=$values['subscribers']?> constituents subscribed

Dear <?=$values['rep_forename']?>,

This is just an automatic update email to let you know that there are
now <?=$values['subscribers']?> constituents in
<?=$values['area_name']?> who would like to hear from you.
All you have to do to send a new message is visit:

    <?=$values['message_url']?>

Remember, you can send email to your constituents whenever you want, just by
clicking on the link, not only when you receive an email from us. Why not
bookmark it?

You or another councillor for your ward have used the service before,
so this is just a short email. We'll remind you again when you have
<?=$values['next_threshold']?>, but we won't email again for at least
one month.

As always, if you have any further questions, please follow this link

Or email us at team@hearfromyourcouncillor.com, or call us on 020 3287 9859.

All the best,

The HearFromYourCouncillor Team
