Subject: <?=$values['subscribers']?> of your constituents would like to hear from you

Dear <?=$values['rep_forename']?>,

This is an email to let you know that there are <?=$values['subscribers']?> constituents
in <?=$values['area_name']?> who would like to hear from you
about any issue you consider to be of particular importance at the
moment. All you have to do to talk to them is visit:

    <?=$values['message_url']?>

This mail has been sent by HearFromYourMP, a free service from mySociety, who
also run WriteToThem, civic action site PledgeBank and TheyWorkForYou.

HearFromYourMP is a strictly non-partisan site which is trying to
build healthier and more productive long-term relationships between
representatives and represented. <?=$values['reps_using']?> MPs have already
used HearFromYourMP to send messages to their constituents -- you can see what
they said at http://www.hearfromyourmp.com/about
 
When you send a message, your constituents will be able to discuss what
you say in a public forum. You can also respond to comments in the
forum if you so wish. The forum has 'post-hoc' moderation, and we have
a strict code of good behavior that we will enforce -- no unconstructive
partisanship, no ad hominem attacks, etc.

This is not a one-off; you can write to your constituents whenever you feel
like, simply by visiting:

    <?=$values['message_url']?>

Constituents will not be able to reply to your mail and write back to
you directly, filling up your inbox. If a constituent wants to write
to you privately they will be passed through to WriteToThem with
all the anti-abuse filters we have built to protect all the UK's
elected representatives, from councillors to MEPs.

If you are not interested in using this service at the moment, we will
send you a reminder when you have <?=$values['next_threshold']?>
constituents signed up. If you have any further questions, please 
follow this link:

Or email us at <?=$values['contact_email']?>, or call us on 020 3287 9859.

All the best,

The HearFromYourMP Team
