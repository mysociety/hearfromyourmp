Subject: <?=$values['subscribers']?> of your constituents would like to hear from you

Dear <?=$values['rep_forename']?>,

We know that you've said in the past you're not interested in making
use of www.HearFromYourCouncillr.com . However, we thought we'd just send you
this reminder in case you'd changed your mind.

There are now <?=$values['subscribers']?> people in your constituency who'd like to hear from
you - all you have to do to talk to them is follow this link:
    <?=$values['message_url']?>

Thus far <?=$values['mps_using']?> councillors have sent messages through the service, and it has over
<?=$values['num_people']?> people signed up nationwide. It's free, popular, and growing. Why
not have a go?

If you have any questions about what HearFromYourCouncillor is, or why you should use
it, then follow this link:

All the best,
The HearFromYourCouncillor team
