Subject: <?=$values['subscribers']?> of your constituents would like to hear from you

Dear <?=$values['rep_forename']?>,

This is an email, sent to all the councillors in <=$values['area_name']?>,
to let you know that there are <?=$values['subscribers']?> of your constituents
who would like to hear from you about any issue you consider to be of particular
importance at the moment. All you have to do to talk to them is visit:
    <?=$values['message_url']?>

This mail has been sent by HearFromYourCouncillor.com, a free service from
charitable project mySociety.org. mySociety.org also runs
www.WriteToThem.com , civic action site
www.PledgeBank.com and www.TheyWorkForYou.com .

HearFromYourCouncillor.com is a strictly non-partisan site which is trying to
build healthier and more productive long-term relationships between
representatives and represented. <?=$values['reps_using']?> councillors have
already used HearFromYourCouncillor to send messages to their constituents --
you can see what they said at
    http://www.hearfromyourcouncillor.com/about
 
When you send a message, your constituents will be able to discuss what
you say in a public forum. You can also respond to comments in the
forum if you so wish. The forum has 'post-hoc' moderation, and we have
a strict code of good behavior that we will enforce -- no unconstructive
partisanship, no ad hominem attacks, etc. You can write to your
constituents whenever you feel like by visiting:
    <?=$values['message_url']?>

Constituents will not be able to reply to your mail and write back to
you directly, filling up your inbox. If a constituent wants to write
to you privately they will be passed through to WriteToThem.com with
all the anti-abuse filters we have built to protect all the UK's
elected representatives, from councillors to MEPs.

If you are not interested in using this service at the moment, we will
send you a reminder when you have <?=$values['next_threshold']?>
constituents signed up. If you have any further questions, please 
follow this link:

All the best,
The HearFromYourCouncillor Team
