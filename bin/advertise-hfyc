You're getting this email because you've previously subscribed to HearFromYourMP in the $const_name constituency.

We're writing because we've just experimentally expanded this service to cover councillors in $council_name too. It's the first location in the UK to get this service, and we hope you'll be interested in having a go.

To sign up to HearFromYourCouncillor in $council_name, just follow this link:

Yours,
The HearFromYourMP team", $headers);
