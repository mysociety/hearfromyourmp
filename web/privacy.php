<h2>Privacy and cookies</h2>

<p><strong>Our use of your data, cookies, and external services: what you should know, and how to opt out if you want to.</strong></p>

<p>Summary: We care a lot about our users’ privacy. We provide details below,
and we try our hardest to look after the private data that we hold. Like many
other websites, we sometimes use cookies and Google Analytics to help us make
our websites better. These tools are very common and used by many other sites,
but they do have privacy implications, and as a charity concerned with socially
positive uses of the internet, we think it’s important to explain them in full.
If you don’t want to share your browsing activities on mySociety’s sites with
other companies, you can adjust your usage or install opt-out browser plugins.

<h3>Privacy</h3>

<p>mySociety will not supply the names, email addresses, postcodes or any
other personal data of constituents to anyone, including <?=$rep_type_plural ?>, except in
two limited circumstances:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>a constituent uses the link we include to WriteToThem.com to contact
their <?=$rep_type ?>, in which case they are obliged to reveal their email and postal
addresses to the <?=$rep_type ?>, in accordance with that site's usage policy.</li>
<li>a constituent chooses to respond on the public forum on <?=$_SERVER['site_name'] ?>,
in which case we will reveal their name only, adjacent to their post(s). We
will not reveal any other information, unless the user includes personal
information on their post.</li>
</ol>

<p>We believe that constituents have the right to listen to what their
representatives say without revealing their identities &mdash; this is what
happens every time someone buys a local newspaper, or stands anonymously
in a crowd listening to an MP. We see no reason to challenge it.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>To make our service easier or more useful, we sometimes place small data files on your computer or mobile phone, known as cookies; many websites do this. We use this information to, for example, remember you have logged in so you don't need to do that on every page, or to measure how people use the website so we can improve it and make sure it works properly. Below, we list the cookies and services that this site can use.

<table cellpadding="5">
<tr align="left"><th scope="col">Name</th><th scope="col">Typical Content</th><th scope="col">Expires</th></tr>
<tr><td>pb_person_id</td><td>A digitally signed token of the logged-in user's numeric ID, and when they logged in</td><td>When browser is closed</td></tr>
<tr><td>test_cookie</td><td>"1", to test if cookies are supported</td><td>When browser is closed</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Measuring website usage (Google Analytics)</h4>

We use Google Analytics to collect information about how people use this site. We do this to make sure it’s meeting its users’ needs and to understand how we could do it better. Google Analytics stores information such as what pages you visit, how long you are on the site, how you got here, what you click on, and information about your web browser. IP addresses are masked (only a portion is stored) and personal information is only reported in aggregate. We do not allow Google to use or share our analytics data for any purpose besides providing us with analytics information, and we recommend that any user of Google Analytics does the same.

<p>If you’re unhappy with data about your visit to be used in this way, you can install the <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">official browser plugin for blocking Google Analytics</a>.

<p>The cookies set by Google Analytics are as follows:

<table>
<tr><th scope="col">Name</th><th scope="col">Typical Content</th><th scope="col">Expires</th></tr>
<tr><td>__utma</td><td>Unique anonymous visitor ID</td><td>2 years</td></tr>
<tr><td>__utmb</td><td>Unique anonymous session ID</td><td>30 minutes</td></tr>
<tr><td>__utmz</td><td>Information on how the site was reached (e.g. direct or via a link/search/advertisement)</td><td>6 months</td></tr>
<tr><td>__utmx</td><td>Which variation of a page you are seeing if we are testing different versions to see which is best</td><td>2 years</td></tr>
</table>
